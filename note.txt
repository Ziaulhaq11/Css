rem or em is based on font 

We can define two classes and order doesnt matter which one is first or not
But in styles which ever class is last that will apply.

Similarly id override class

And inline styles overrides outline style
!important will override everyother style

Absolute length -px
Relative length -em,rem

Variables :
--var_name : ;
var(--var_name)
previously we defined variable in parent class then it applies to all
child classes
If we want to define global variable inside root element
:root {
    var
}

Media queries can change variables depends on the size of screen

Align items we write in container

Align self in individual item and it will overwrite align-items
