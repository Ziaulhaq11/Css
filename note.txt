rem or em is based on font 

We can define two classes and order doesnt matter which one is first or not
But in styles which ever class is last that will apply.

Similarly id override class

And inline styles overrides outline style
!important will override everyother style

Absolute length -px
Relative length -em,rem

Variables :
--var_name : ;
var(--var_name)
